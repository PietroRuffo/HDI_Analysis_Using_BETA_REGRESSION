Inequality is everywhere, and in some parts of the world it can be an affront to human dignity. Inequalities in human development hurt societies by weakening social cohesion and people's trust in government, institutions and ultimately each other.  It is evident that human development cannot be conceived only from an economic perspective but in a broader perspective that can also embrace other areas equally important for development: it is for this reason that in 1990 the need was felt to introduce the human development index.   This index was created to integrate and overcome the vision of development as mere economic growth, expressed by GDP. The Human Development Index is, in fact, a broader measure than GDP and also provides important information on the health and level of schooling of a country, configuring itself in this way as a multidimensional index.  The objective of the research is to build a model for estimating the Human Development Index in order to identify the factors that have a greater impact on it as well as highlight any limitations.
